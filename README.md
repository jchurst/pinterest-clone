# Pinterest Clone

## User stories:

1- As an unauthenticated user, I can login with Twitter.

2- As an authenticated user, I can link to images.

3- As an authenticated user, I can delete images that I've linked to.

4- As an authenticated user, I can see a Pinterest-style wall of all the images I've linked to.

5- As an unauthenticated user, I can browse other users' walls of images.

6- As an authenticated user, if I upload an image that is broken, it will be replaced by a placeholder image. (can use jQuery broken image detection)

Hint: Masonry.js is a library that allows for Pinterest-style image grids.
